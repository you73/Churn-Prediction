# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn using advanced predictive modeling techniques. The goal is to identify the key factors driving churn and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Altair, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: RandomizedSearchCV

## Key Results
- **Feature Importance**: Membership category is the most significant factor influencing churn.
- **Model Performance**: Tree-based models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) demonstrated superior accuracy and reliability.
- **Optimization Strategies**:
  - Adjusting classification thresholds improved recall for the "Churn" class.
  - Ensemble learning techniques enhanced overall predictive performance.

## How to Use
